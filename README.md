# rorr-loadout-randomizer
loadout randomizer for risk of rain returns

## Install
- You can compile using Rust instructions on how to compile. Generally it's `cargo build -r`, then the executable can be found in the `target/release` directory. There are precompiled Windows and Mac versions in the releases tab.

## Use
- Windows: Double click on the `generate-loadout.exe` executable or run in a terminal.
- Mac and Linux: Run the `generate-loadout` executable in a terminal.
- The survivors.yml file must be present in the same directory as the app, and can be easily modified to add/remove survivors.
- While the app is running, you can press `esc`, `q`, or `ctrl-c` to exit. Any other key will generate a new loadout.
